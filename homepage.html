    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <hr class="layui-border-black">
    <div>
        <p>Given the high attrition rates, substantial costs and slow pace of new drug discovery and development, repurposing of 'old' drugs to treat both common and rare diseases is increasingly becoming an attractive proposition because it involves the use of de-risked compounds, with potentially lower overall development costs and shorter development timelines. Various data-driven and experimental approaches have been suggested for the identification of repurposable drug candidates; however, there are also major technological and regulatory challenges that need to be addressed.</p>
        <br>
        As another important aspect of pharmaceutical research, drug-drug interactions (DDI) occur when the presence of another drug modifies the effect of one drug. DDIs are broadly classified into pharmacodynamic (PD: effect vs. time) and pharmacokinetic (PK: concentration vs. time). The investigation of DDIs, focusing on PK, PD, and their relationships, can support the discovery and development of new drugs in the pharmaceutical industry.  Developing advanced data mining, machine learning, and natural language processing methods and applying them to Spontaneous reports (e.g., FAERS), electronic health records, and the literature can generate and prioritize DDI hypotheses, which can support large pragmatic randomized trials to confirm actual DDIs.</p>
        <br>
        The goal of this workshop is to provide a unique platform to bring together researchers and practitioners in healthcare informatics working with drug discovery and development, and facilitate close interaction among students, scholars, and industry professionals on drug repurposing challenges worldwide.</p>

        <p><a style="color: red" href="https://www.ieee.org/conferences/publishing/templates.html" target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'><ins>Template</ins></a></p>
        <p>AIPHA will accept both regular papers (4-8 pages, including references) and abstracts (2 pages, including references). Regular papers will describe mature ideas, where a substantial amount of implementation, experimentation, or data collection and analysis has been completed. Abstracts will describe innovative ideas, where preliminary implementation and validation work have been conducted.</p>
        <p><br></p>
        <p>Submissions will be handled electronically through <a style="color: red" href="https://easychair.org/account/signin" target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'><ins>EasyChair</ins></a>.  When submitting papers, the authors must select the "<a style="color: red">HAIPHA Workshop</a>" track. Papers must adhere to the <a style="color: red" href="https://easychair.org/account/signin" target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'><ins>IEEE Proceedings Format</ins></a> and be submitted as a single PDF file. Before a submission is sent to the reviewers, the program chairs will perform an assessment to determine the best fit for the submission.</p>
        <p>AIPHA uses a single-blind two-layer peer reviewing process. The final decision will be made by the program chairs based on at least two reviews by program committee members. All accepted submissions will be presented at the workshop and published in the IEEE ICHI 2023 Proceedings (archived in IEEE Xplore Digital Library).</p>
