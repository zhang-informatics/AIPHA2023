<h1>The First international Workshop on AI for Pharmaceutical Discovery and Development (AIPHA 2023) at ICHI</h1>

<div class="description">
    <p>Given the high attrition rates, substantial costs and slow pace of new drug discovery and development, repurposing of 'old' drugs to treat both common and rare diseases is increasingly becoming an attractive proposition because it involves the use of de-risked compounds, with potentially lower overall development costs and shorter development timelines. Various data-driven and experimental approaches have been suggested for the identification of repurposable drug candidates; however, there are also major technological and regulatory challenges that need to be addressed.</p>
    <p><br></p>
    <p>As another important aspect of pharmaceutical research, drug-drug interactions (DDI) occur when the presence of another drug modifies the effect of one drug. DDIs are broadly classified into pharmacodynamic (PD: effect vs. time) and pharmacokinetic (PK: concentration vs. time). The investigation of DDIs, focusing on PK, PD, and their relationships, can support the discovery and development of new drugs in the pharmaceutical industry.  Developing advanced data mining, machine learning, and natural language processing methods and applying them to Spontaneous reports (e.g., FAERS), electronic health records, and the literature can generate and prioritize DDI hypotheses, which can support large pragmatic randomized trials to confirm actual DDIs.</p>
    <p><br></p>
    <p>The goal of this workshop is to provide a unique platform to bring together researchers and practitioners in healthcare informatics working with drug discovery and development, and facilitate close interaction among students, scholars, and industry professionals on drug repurposing challenges worldwide.</p>
